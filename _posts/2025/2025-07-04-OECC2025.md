Heeyun Jung, a master’s student, participated in OECC 2025 held in Sapporo, Japan, where he gave an oral presentation titled “High-Performance SiN Grating Coupler with a Metal Bottom Reflector on Glass for Co-Packaged Optical Systems” (oral acceptance rate: 46.9%). He presented design and simulation results for a CPO-optimized grating coupler. We will deliver experimental results of highly-efficient SiN grating coupler on a glass susbstrate.
